👋 Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀

Hi, I'm Lukas, passionate about applying Data Science, Web3, and Machine Learning to explore decentralized systems. My work centers on understanding governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and leveraging data-driven insights for blockchain innovation. 


**📖 About Me:**
I’m a PhD Candidate at the TUM School of Management, Technical University of Munich, and visiting at Department of Engineering, Cambridge University, UK, working at the intersection of AI and Web3. 

🔍 **Research Interests:** Data Science, DAO Governance, Blockchain Analytics, AI and Agents for Decentralized Systems

🌱 **Currently Exploring:** Agentic Infrastructures, Agents for DAO Governance


🛠️ **Skills:**
Data Science, Machine Learning, Python, R, SQL

🚀 **Featured Projects:**
For now, check out my [Semi-Supervised Classifier for Cryptocurrency Price Movements](https://github.com/hash00x1/semi-supervised-crypto-forecasting)
and the langchain-based [Base-repo for Complex Agentic Workflows](https://github.com/ArchipelAi/archipel-monorepo).

**Upcoming Work:**
In time, I will open source the base-code for my [Orchestrator framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05651) - developed in collaboration with the University of Cambridge. As well as a fun project framework for multi-agent based crypto trading. Stay tuned...
